## :wrench: Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.7 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 1.7](https://pytorch.org/)
- Option: NVIDIA GPU + [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- Option: Linux

### Installation

We now provide a *clean* version of GFPGAN, which does not require customized CUDA extensions. <br>
If you want to use the original model in our paper, please see [PaperModel.md](PaperModel.md) for installation.

1. Clone repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git
    cd GFPGAN
    ```

1. Install dependent packages

    ```bash
    # Install basicsr - https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR
    # We use BasicSR for both training and inference
    pip install basicsr

    # Install facexlib - https://github.com/xinntao/facexlib
    # We use face detection and face restoration helper in the facexlib package
    pip install facexlib

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

    # If you want to enhance the background (non-face) regions with Real-ESRGAN,
    # you also need to install the realesrgan package
    pip install realesrgan
    
    venv\Lib\site-packages\basicsr\data\degradations.py
    venv\Lib\site-packages\facexlib\detection\retinaface.py
    
    ```

## :zap: Quick Inference

We take the v1.3 version for an example. More models can be found [here](#european_castle-model-zoo).

Download pre-trained models: [GFPGANv1.3.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth)

```bash
wget https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth -P experiments/pretrained_models
```

**Inference!**

```bash
python inference_gfpgan.py -i inputs/whole_imgs -o results -v 1.3 -s 2
```

```console
Usage: python inference_gfpgan.py -i inputs/whole_imgs -o results -v 1.3 -s 2 [options]...

  -h                   show this help
  -i input             Input image or folder. Default: inputs/whole_imgs
  -o output            Output folder. Default: results
  -v version           GFPGAN model version. Option: 1 | 1.2 | 1.3. Default: 1.3
  -s upscale           The final upsampling scale of the image. Default: 2
  -bg_upsampler        background upsampler. Default: realesrgan
  -bg_tile             Tile size for background sampler, 0 for no tile during testing. Default: 400
  -suffix              Suffix of the restored faces
  -only_center_face    Only restore the center face
  -aligned             Input are aligned faces
  -ext                 Image extension. Options: auto | jpg | png, auto means using the same extension as inputs. Default: auto
```

If you want to use the original model in our paper, please see [PaperModel.md](PaperModel.md) for installation and inference.

## :european_castle: Models

| Version | Model Name  | Description |
| :---: | :---:        |     :---:      |
| V1.3 | [GFPGANv1.3.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth) | Based on V1.2; **more natural** restoration results; better results on very low-quality / high-quality inputs. |
| V1.2 | [GFPGANCleanv1-NoCE-C2.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.2.0/GFPGANCleanv1-NoCE-C2.pth) | No colorization; no CUDA extensions are required. Trained with more data with pre-processing. |
| V1 | [GFPGANv1.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/GFPGANv1.pth) | The paper model, with colorization. |
